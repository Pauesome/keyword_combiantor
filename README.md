# keyword_combinator
Combinations.py is a python code that combines different words into one keyword.

The objective is to create keywords based in the combinations (ie. Word 1: buy, Word 2: car, bike --> Keywords: buy car, buy bike)

In order to execute the code, I use either Google Colab or Visual Studio Code depending on whether I want to save the file in my Google Drive or in my PC.

To identify the words that need to combine, each list is attributed a name (A, B, C, D). (line 4-7)
You can create more lists if you wish to make more combinations (E, F, G...)

Below the lists, feel free to edit the combination rules to you liking :)

Once you've set all the combinations and run the code, it will automatically create a file called "combinations.csv" (line 41) and save it either in Google Drive (Google Colab contents folder) or in the PC folder that you told it to.
